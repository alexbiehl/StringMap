StringMap
=========


About
-----

An efficient implementation of maps from strings to arbitrary values.
Values can associated with an arbitrary byte key.
Searching for keys is very fast, but the prefix tree probably consumes
more memory than "Data.Map". The main differences are the special
'prefixFind' functions, which can be used to perform prefix queries.

StringMap was originally developed as part of the holumbus project of the FH-Wedel.
It is now a separate cabal package.
